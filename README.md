A class named Solution is defined here. It has one public method canJump which takes a reference to a vector of integers as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to reach the last index of the vector from the first index.
This method implements the logic to determine if it's possible to jump to the last index.
It iterates through each position in the input vector until the second-to-last index.
It checks if the current position plus the maximum jump from this position can reach or exceed the last index. If yes, it returns true.
If the current position contains 0, it attempts to find a position before it which can jump over it.
If it cannot find such a position, it returns false.
Finally, if the size of nums is 1, it means there's only one element, so it's reachable by default.
In the main function, an instance of the Solution class is created.
A sample vector v is created and initialized.
The canJump method is called with this vector, and the result is stored in the result variable.
Depending on the result, "true" or "false" is printed.
This code essentially checks whether it's possible to reach the last index of the input array nums by performing jumps based on the values at each index. If it's possible, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
